    <h1>Flash Flood Hazard in Mallorca, Spain; Scenario 2</h1>
    <h1>Scenario with Early Warning System</h1>

    <p>In <strong>Scenario 2</strong>, we incorporate an early warning system to alert individuals before a flash flood occurs. With the early warning system in place, any agent who (1) is within the flood risk area and (2) is in a building with only one floor is programmed to promptly head to the nearest safe location upon receiving the warning. This safe location is either determined by local authorities or the nearest building with higher floors. Additionally, this scenario takes into account the effects of the temporal dynamics and spatial extent of the flooding over the observed period on the road network, thus impacting the dynamics of the evacuation process.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> <span style="color: red;"><strong> Using OSM data to build the traffic network, calibrated by local experts for type and capacities of each link. The early warning system sends an evacuation message 30 minutes prior to the expected flash flood, allowing individuals to begin evacuation earlier and potentially reducing congestion on the roads.</strong></span></li>
        <li><strong>Population Demographics:</strong> Basic scenario with all individuals starting evacuation from their homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Evacuation Policy:</strong> <span style="color: red;"><strong>People who (1) are within the flood risk area and (2) are in a building with only one floor are suggested to promptly head to the nearest safe location upon receiving the evacuation message. This safe location is either determined by local authorities or the nearest building with higher floors. Meanwhile, others seek a safe place within their residence (if inside the risk area) or do nothing (if outside the risk area).</strong></span></li>
        <li><strong>Hazard Model:</strong> We use the flood progression model to determine the links that get affected. By doing so, if an agent is on a link that gets affected or there is no alternative way to reach a safe place, they get stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Behavior Model:</strong> All individuals follow instructions and proceed on foot to designated evacuation sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Simulation Results</h2>

    <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) of Different Events in Scenario 2- This figure illustrates the distribution of events such as 'Go See Flooded Area,' 'Seek Nearby Shelter,' 'Move to Higher Ground or Evacuate Area,' 'Home (Wait, Stay, or Return),' and 'Stuck.' Notably, 121 individuals are categorized as 'Stuck' in Scenario 2.</p>
