    <h1>Flash Flood Hazard in Mallorca, Spain; Scenario 1</h1>
    <h1>Basic Scenario</h1>

    <p>In <strong>Scenario 1</strong>, we assume complete compliance from all individuals with the flood evacuation protocol. Consequently, in the event of a flash flood occurring without any pre-warning systems in place, any agent who (1) is within the flood risk area and (2) is in a building with only one floor is programmed to promptly head to the nearest safe location. This safe location is either determined by local authorities or the nearest building with higher floors. Additionally, this scenario incorporates the effects of the temporal dynamics and spatial extent of the flooding over the observed period on the road network and therefore on the dynamics of the evacuation.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Using OSM data to build the traffic network, calibrated by local experts for type and capacities of each link.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Demographics:</strong> Basic scenario with all individuals starting evacuation from their homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Evacuation Policy:</strong> People who (1) are within the flood risk area and (2) are in a building with only one floor are suggested to promptly head to the nearest safe location, whether determined by local authorities or the nearest building with higher floors. Meanwhile, others seek a safe place within their residence (if inside the risk area) or do nothing (if outside the risk area).</li>
        <li><strong>Hazard Model:</strong> We use the flood progression model to determine the links that get affected. By doing so, if an agent is on a link that gets affected or there is no alternative way to reach a safe place, they get stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Behavior Model:</strong> All individuals follow instructions and proceed on foot to designated evacuation sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Simulation Results</h2>
    <p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Population Distribution - This figure highlights the percentage of people within (outside) the flood risk area and the percentage of people living in unsafe residences within the risk area.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) of Different Events in Scenario 1 - This figure illustrates the distribution of events such as 'Go See Flooded Area,' 'Seek Nearby Shelter,' 'Move to Higher Ground or Evacuate Area,' 'Home (Wait, Stay, or Return),' and 'Stuck.' Notably, 176 individuals are categorized as 'Stuck' in Scenario 1.</p>
