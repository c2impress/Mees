<body>
    <h1>Earthquake Hazard in Egaleo, Greece; Scenario 1</h1>
    <h1>Baseline Scenario</h1>

    <p>In <strong>Scenario 1</strong>, we assume complete compliance from all individuals with the evacuation protocol. Accordingly, upon an earthquake, all defined agents are programmed to promptly head to the nearest evacuation center on foot. Given that capacity limitations for safe places have not been assumed in this scenario, it establishes a baseline by guaranteeing that all agents rigorously follow the designated evacuation procedure, with no deviations.</p>
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Using OSM data to build the traffic network, calibrated by local experts for type and capacities of each link.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Demographics:</strong> Late-night scenario with all individuals starting evacuation from their homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Evacuation Policy:</strong> All individuals proceed to the nearest official open space.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazard Model:</strong> Data from the 1999 Athens earthquake used to identify links blocked by debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Behavior Model:</strong> All individuals follow instructions and proceed on foot to designated evacuation sites.</li>
      </ul>
