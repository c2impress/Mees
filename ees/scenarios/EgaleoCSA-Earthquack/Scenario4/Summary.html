    <h1>Earthquake Hazard in Egaleo, Greece; Scenario 4</h1>
    <h1>Real-World Behavioral Patterns in Evacuation Modeling with Updated Evacuation Centers</h1>

    <p>In <strong>Scenario 4</strong>, we integrate the feedback from the focus group investigating our framework into the ABM simulations. The head of Social Services in Egaleo noted that Irini Square (i.e., <a href="GeneratedNetwork.png" target="_blank">O1</a>) is unsuitable for gathering large crowds, especially during an earthquake, due to the presence of large trees and exposed wires that could fall.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> <span style="color: red;"><strong> Using OSM data to build the traffic network, calibrated by local experts for the type and capacities of each link. We also update public open spaces used in the simulation by considering limitations raised by the focus group.</strong></span></li>
        <li><strong>Population Demographics:</strong> Late-night scenario with all individuals starting evacuation from their homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Evacuation Policy:</strong> Everyone proceed to the nearest designated open area with available capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazard Model:</strong> Data from the 1999 Athens earthquake used to identify links blocked by debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Behavior Model:</strong> Evacuating populations involves individuals with diverse behaviors and reactions to hazards, influenced by social ties, prior experience, training, risk perception, cultural backgrounds, cognitive biases, and psychological states. </li>
    </ul>
