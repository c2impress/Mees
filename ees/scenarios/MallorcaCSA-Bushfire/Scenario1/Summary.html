    <h1>Bushfire Hazard in Mallorca, Spain; Scenario 1</h1>
    <h1>Basic Scenario</h1>

    <p>In <strong>Scenario 1</strong>, we assume complete compliance from all individuals with the fire evacuation protocol. Consequently, in the event of a bushfire occurring without any pre-warning systems in place, any agent who is within the fire risk area is programmed to promptly head to a safe location. Additionally, this scenario incorporates the effects of the temporal dynamics and spatial extent of the fire over the observed period on the road network and therefore on the dynamics of the evacuation.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Using OSM data to build the traffic network, calibrated by local experts for type and capacities of each link.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Demographics:</strong> Basic scenario with all individuals starting evacuation from their homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Evacuation Policy:</strong> People who are within the fire risk area are programmed to head to the safe location.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazard Model:</strong> We use the fire progression model to determine the links that get affected. By doing so, if an agent is on a link that gets affected or there is no alternative way to reach a safe place, they get stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Behavior Model:</strong> All individuals follow instructions and proceed on foot to designated evacuation sites.</li>
    </ul>
